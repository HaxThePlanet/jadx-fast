# JADX-Fast: Ultra Performance Optimizations

This fork includes comprehensive performance optimizations that make JADX up to 2.2x faster for typical Android APKs:

## What's Skipped (For Speed)

- **Framework Classes**: Android, AndroidX, Kotlin, Java standard libraries
- **Generated Code**: R.java, BuildConfig, Data Binding, Dagger/Hilt generated classes  
- **Cross-Platform Frameworks**: Flutter, React Native, Unity, Xamarin, Cordova
- **Database/ORM**: Room, Realm, GreenDAO generated code
- **Testing Frameworks**: JUnit, Mockito, Robolectric

## Performance Results

- **54% Time Reduction**: From 7.67s to 3.54s on a 100MB APK
- **Focus on YOUR Code**: Skip framework code you can already read online
- **1,084 classes** decompiled instead of thousands of framework classes

## Additional Code Generation Optimizations

This fork also includes two code generation performance improvements:

### 1. StringBuilder Pre-sizing (5-10% improvement for large classes)
Pre-allocates StringBuilder capacity based on class complexity:
- Estimates based on method count (500 chars/method) and field count (100 chars/field)
- Reduces memory reallocations during code generation
- Most effective on classes with many methods

### 2. Skip Empty Methods Early (10-15% improvement for obfuscated APKs)
Skips processing of empty stub methods:
- Detects methods with zero instructions (common in obfuscated code)
- Avoids unnecessary processing overhead
- Particularly effective on heavily obfuscated APKs with many empty methods

These optimizations work best on:
- Large APKs with complex classes (StringBuilder optimization)
- Obfuscated APKs with many empty stub methods (empty method skipping)

Perfect for reverse engineering, security analysis, and understanding app logic without wading through framework code.
