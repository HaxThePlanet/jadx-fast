Issue: Exception handler variable scope resolution failure in CFG decompilation.
Exception block code was being placed in try block instead of catch block.

Root Cause: Handler blocks with addresses within the try address range were being
included in try_block_ids. These blocks belong to the exception handlers, not the
try body.

Fix: After computing handler_blocks via collect_handler_blocks_by_dominance(),
remove all handler blocks from try_block_ids. This matches JADX's approach in
prepareTryBlocks() where it does: blocks.removeAll(eh.getBlocks())
