Task: P1-CONTROL-FLOW-POLISH - Switch/Loop/Try-Catch Edge Cases
Claimed: 2025-12-25
Agent: Chad
Session: ACTIVE

Status: IN PROGRESS

Priority: P1 (Code quality improvements)
Estimated Impact: +0.5-1% quality (97-97.5% parity)
Effort: Medium

Scope:
- Switch case ordering and fallthrough handling
- Nested loop logic and break/continue semantics
- Try-catch block edge cases and exception handling
- Compound control flow patterns

Examples of edge cases to handle:
- Switch cases with missing breaks
- Nested loops with labeled breaks
- Try-finally without catch blocks
- Exception handler ordering
- Fall-through patterns in conditionals

Reference: JADX control flow handling in IfRegionVisitor.java, LoopRegionVisitor.java, TryCatchRegionVisitor.java

Testing:
- Verify switch statements maintain correct case ordering
- Verify loop break/continue semantics preserved
- Verify try-catch-finally generates correct code

Status: 🔄 IN PROGRESS (Dec 25, 2025)
