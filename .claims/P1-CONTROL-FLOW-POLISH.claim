Claimed: 2025-12-25
Agent: Chad
Session: ACTIVE

Status: PHASE 1 COMPLETE ✅ (Dec 25, 2025)

Priority: P1 (Code quality improvements)
Estimated Total Impact: +0.5-1% quality (97-97.5% parity)
Effort: Medium

PHASE 1 - Switch Break Insertion: ✅ COMPLETE (Dec 25, 2025)
- Implemented insert_switch_breaks() in post_process_regions.rs
- Added region_always_exits() - checks if region ends with return/throw/break/continue
- Added insert_break_at_end() - appends Break region to non-exiting cases
- Impact: +0.2-0.3%
- All 18 CLI integration tests pass ✅
- All switch break unit tests pass ✅

PHASES 2-5 - Lower Priority (Lower ROI):
- Phase 2: Continue-in-switch (requires major refactoring, +0.1%)
- Phase 3: Switch case reordering (complex, +0.15%)
- Phase 4: Break labels (already adequate, +0.05%)
- Phase 5: Continue for synthetic blocks (very low impact, +0.05%)

Status: Phase 1 delivered, Phases 2-5 require major pipeline refactoring (lower priority)
