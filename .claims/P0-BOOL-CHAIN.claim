Task: P0-BOOL-CHAIN - Truncated Boolean Chains
Claimed: 2025-12-24
Agent: Claude Opus 4.5

Status: COMPLETED

Problem:
Complex boolean OR chains are truncated after first condition.
Example: detectEmulator$lambda$1() - JADX has 40 lines, Dexterity has 12

Root Cause:
In region_builder.rs process_if(), else_blocks were being added to the exit
barrier when building then_region. This prevented nested conditionals from
including the shared "true" target (block 14) in their else_regions.

JADX Reference: IfRegionMaker.java:88 only adds outBlock (merge point) as exit,
NOT the else_block. Dexterity was incorrectly adding else_blocks as exits.

Fix:
Removed the code in process_if() that added else_blocks to the exit set.
The merge point is still added as exit, but else_blocks remain accessible
for nested conditionals to include in their else_regions.

Location: crates/dexterity-passes/src/region_builder.rs:2065-2072

Result:
- Before: 12 lines with single truncated condition
- After: ~50 lines with all 14 nested conditions

Output now matches JADX's nested if pattern:
if (!startsWith(FINGERPRINT, "generic")) {
    if (!startsWith(FINGERPRINT, "unknown")) {
        if (!contains(MODEL, "google_sdk")) {
            ... 11 more nested ifs ...
            return false;
        }
    }
}
return true;
