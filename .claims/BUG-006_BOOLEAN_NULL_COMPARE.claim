Working on: BUG-006 - Boolean compared to null

Problem: Boolean expressions compared to null instead of using proper negation.
Example:
  Dexterity (BROKEN):
    while (this.acceptSocket.isClosed() == null) {  // isClosed() returns boolean!

  JADX (CORRECT):
    while (!this.acceptSocket.isClosed()) {

Files affected: NanoHTTPD.java and others
Priority: P0 (CRITICAL)
Category: Boolean Expression Generation

Root cause: Boolean method results being treated as nullable objects.
