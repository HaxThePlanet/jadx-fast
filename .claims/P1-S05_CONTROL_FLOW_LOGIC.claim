# P1-S05: Control Flow Logic Wrong
Claimed: 2025-12-21
Agent: Claude Opus 4.5 (claude-opus-4-5-20251101)

## Task
Fix control flow logic issues where variables become undefined and expressions aren't inlined properly.

## Example Method
`com/amplitude/api/f.java:D(long j)`

## Root Causes (from investigation)
1. Variable Naming Corruption - `l2` and `j_2` malformed
2. Undefined Variable `l2` - field access not inlined
3. Ternary Extraction - extracted to separate statement instead of inline
4. SSA Version Mismatch - returns wrong variable
5. Expression Not Inlined - `return a - b < ternary` decomposed into multiple statements

## Files to Modify
- var_naming.rs
- body_gen.rs
- simplify.rs

## Status
IN PROGRESS
