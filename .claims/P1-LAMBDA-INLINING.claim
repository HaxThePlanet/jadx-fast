Task: P1-LAMBDA-INLINING - Real Lambda Inlining (not suppression)
Claimed: 2025-12-25
Agent: Chad
Session: ACTIVE

Status: IN PROGRESS

Priority: P1 (Major feature - +1-2% quality gain)
Estimated Impact: +1-2% (96-97% parity)
Effort: Hard

Current State:
- Lambda classes are SUPPRESSED (not output at all)
- Badboy APK: 55 files (vs JADX's 86) - 31 lambda classes suppressed
- Need to INLINE lambda code into parent classes instead

Goal:
- Inline lambda methods into their parent class declarations
- Convert 55 files → 86 files to match JADX coverage
- Lambda classes become parent class methods (anonymous inner functions)

Scope:
- Lambda method body extraction
- Parent class integration
- Variable scoping and closure handling
- Type parameter preservation

Complexity:
- Hard effort: Requires understanding lambda semantics, method inlining strategy
- Reference: JADX InsnGen.java:806-1090 (lambda inlining logic)
- Must maintain correctness while simplifying output

Testing:
- Verify badboy-x86.apk outputs 86 files (match JADX)
- Verify lambda methods appear inline in parent classes
- Verify variable captures work correctly

Status: 🔄 IN PROGRESS (Dec 25, 2025)
