Working on: BUG-002 - Undefined variables d/d2 in division expressions

Problem: Variables like `d` and `d2` are used in division expressions but never declared.
Example:
  Dexterity (BROKEN):
    arr[i7] = Double.valueOf(d /= l);   // 'd' never declared
    arr[i8] = Double.valueOf(d2 /= l);  // 'd2' never declared

  JADX (CORRECT):
    Double.valueOf(this.sessionLength / 1000.0d)

Files affected: 10+ files in medium APK
Priority: P0 (CRITICAL)
Category: Variable Declaration/Scope

Root cause: SSA variable elimination too aggressive, or variable declarations
not being emitted before compound assignment expressions.


FIX STATUS: IMPLEMENTED - Sat Dec 20 10:32:26 AM PST 2025
