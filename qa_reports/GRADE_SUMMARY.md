**Generated:** December 21, 2025
**See:** [ISSUE_TRACKER.md](../docs/ISSUE_TRACKER.md) for tracked issues

## Executive Summary

| APK | JADX Files | Dex Files | Raw % | Adjusted % | Quality | Defects | Overall | Grade |
|-----|------------|-----------|-------|------------|---------|---------|---------|-------|
| small | 2 | 1 | 50.0% | **100%** | 100.0% | 100.0% | 90.0% | **A** |
| medium | 5,933 | 3,072 | 51.8% | **98.2%** | 70.0% | 90.3% | 76.5% | **B-** |
| large | 8,161 | 7,093 | 86.9% | **~97%*** | 80.8% | 93.1% | 88.2% | **B+** |
| badboy | 86 | 53 | 61.6% | **98.5%** | 91.0% | 95.9% | 87.6% | **B+** |
| badboy-x86 | 46 | 13 | 28.3% | **~97%** | 75.2% | 93.6% | 75.0% | **B-** |

**Adjusted %** = After excluding intentionally filtered classes (frameworks/libraries)

\* Large APK: Files exist but under obfuscated package paths (Kotlin package name deobfuscation gap)

---

## Understanding "Missing" Files

Most "missing" files are **intentionally filtered** by design:

### Intentional Exclusions (by design)
- `android.*`, `androidx.*`, `kotlin.*`, `kotlinx.*` - Framework classes
- `java.*`, `javax.*`, `sun.*` - JDK classes
- `com/google/*` - Google libraries
- `com/facebook/*`, `com/twitter/*` - Social SDKs
- `okhttp3/*`, `okio/*`, `retrofit2/*` - Networking libraries
- `io/reactivex/*`, `rx/*` - Reactive extensions
- `org/jetbrains/*`, `org/intellij/*` - JetBrains annotations
- `R.java`, `R$*.java`, `BuildConfig.java` - Generated code
- `*_Factory.java`, `*_HiltModules` - Dagger/Hilt generated

### Breakdown by APK

| APK | Total Missing | Intentional | Real Bugs | Bug Rate |
|-----|---------------|-------------|-----------|----------|
| small | 1 | 1 (R.java) | 0 | 0% |
| medium | 2,972 | 2,919 | 53 | 1.8% |
| large | 3,003 | 2,149 | 854 | 10.5% |
| badboy | 33 | 32 | 1 | 3% |
| badboy-x86 | 33 | 32 | 1 | 3% |

## Real Missing Files (Bugs to Fix)

### Medium APK (53 bugs)
All from `com/appsflyer/*` - AppsFlyer SDK (should be added to skip list)

### Large APK (854 "missing" - actually path differences)
| Package | Count | Note |
|---------|-------|------|
| `app/dogo/com/dogo_android/*` | ~688 | **Path difference** - files exist but under obfuscated package names (e.g., `camerax/` → `c/`) |
| `com/revenuecat/purchases/*` | 42 | RevenueCat SDK (add to skip list) |
| `e/a/a/a/b/*` | ~60 | Obfuscated code |
| `zendesk/support/*` | 7 | Zendesk SDK (add to skip list) |

**Note:** JADX applies Kotlin metadata to deobfuscate package names (`c` → `camerax`). Dexterity keeps obfuscated names. This is a **Kotlin package deobfuscation gap**, not missing files.

### Badboy APKs (1 bug each)
- `com/prototype/badboy/ComposableSingletons$MainActivityKt.java` - Kotlin synthetic

---

## Code Quality Differences

### Small APK: Near-Perfect Parity
Only difference: Dexterity adds `/* compiled from: */` comment

### Medium/Large APKs
| Aspect | JADX | Dexterity | Winner |
|--------|------|-----------|--------|
| Variable naming | 0.93 | 0.70-0.81 | JADX |
| Method naming | 1.00 | 1.00 | Tie |
| Package naming | 1.00 | 1.00 | Tie |
| Enum references | Unqualified | Qualified | Preference |
| Switch tables | Try-catch wrapped | Direct | Dexterity (cleaner) |
| Long literals | `0` | `0L` | Dexterity (more explicit) |

---

## Recommendations

### POL-001: Add Missing Library Filters
Add these to `should_skip_class_full()` in `main.rs:1636`:
```rust
"Lcom/appsflyer/",    // AppsFlyer SDK
"Lcom/revenuecat/",   // RevenueCat SDK
"Lzendesk/",          // Zendesk SDK
```
Expected impact: ~100 fewer "missing" files

### GAP-001: Kotlin Package Name Deobfuscation
JADX uses Kotlin metadata to restore obfuscated package names (`c` → `camerax`). Dexterity preserves obfuscated names. Implementing this would achieve better parity for Kotlin apps.

**Example mappings in large APK:**
- `c/` → `camerax/`
- `e/` → `clicker/`
- `f/` → `dailyworkout/`

### GAP-002: Variable Naming Quality
Dexterity variable naming quality (0.70-0.81) is lower than JADX (0.93). Focus on improving type-based naming heuristics.

## Overall Assessment

**Current Grade: B (Good Parity)**

- Small APKs: **A** - Near-identical output
- Medium APKs: **B-** - Intentional filtering explains most gaps, variable naming needs work
- Large APKs: **B+** - Good parity, Kotlin package deobfuscation gap (files exist under obfuscated paths)
- Badboy APKs: **B/B-** - Good parity for malware analysis

**For 1:1 parity target:**
1. GAP-001: Implement Kotlin package name deobfuscation (`c` → `camerax`)
2. GAP-002: Improve variable naming quality (+23% gap to close)
3. POL-001: Add 3 more SDK prefixes to skip list (appsflyer, revenuecat, zendesk)
